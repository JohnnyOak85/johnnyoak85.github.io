    Oh hey there fellow developer!
    Yeah, everything here is just HTML and fancy CSS tricks.

                <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
                Hello! Welcome to my interactive CV! The idea here was to keep it simple and not use any scripts.<br>
                As for me, I'm a lover of all forms of art and to me, programming is also a form of art. Creating
                something cool out of that black canvas a really rewarding experience.
                Being persistent and an early bird means I will start strong and not rest until I find a solution that
                satisfies me.

                <h4>Hyrule Warriors Maps</h4>
                <p>September 2020 to Present</p>
                I love the Legend of Zelda series. But Hyrule Warriors is a very distinct entry in the franchise, with
                a lot of things to do and unlock. Being dissatisfied with the available guides, I decided to take
                matters into my own hands and make my own guide app.<br>
                Using a Ionic Angular base, I've constructed a simple app that facilitates navigation through each
                game map.<br>

                <p>April 2020 to Present</p>
                Moderating a Discord server is a challenging job and upon investigating existing
                moderation bots I noticed that they either function poorly or hide basic features behind paywalls.
                What better way to solve that issue than to program my own bot?<br>
                Written in JavaScript using the Discord.js library, the bot does all the usual moderation functions and
                a few automatic tasks. It also keeps a record of user information relevant for moderation.<br>

                to only use HTML and cool CSS tricks.<br>

                A short platforming video game I started as part of a small team of game developers.
                As the sole software developer, I built the main engine of the game using Game Maker Language.
                The project was scrapped and the team disbanded, but I kept the basic skeleton of the engine.<br>

                <p>April 2019</p>
                A 24 hour "hackathon", final project of &lt;Academia de C&oacute;digo_&gt;. The theme
                was Disney Animation film songs, our group had "A Whole New World" from Disney's
                "Aladdin" and was composed of 6 people. We decided to build a tour guide app. A
                user would create a profile with his interests and then would choose a city to
                visit. The app would then match tour guides who were located on that city and
                had the same interests. This way a person could have a much more personalized
                trip to a city of their choosing. I was in charge of the front end using JavaScript.<br>

                A challenge to create a simple video game using our still limited Java knowledge.
                First big project at &lt;Academia de C&oacute;digo_&gt;. I was part of a randomized
                group of 4 people and we had a week to finish the project. We chose a space
                themed game were the player had to dodge asteroids.<br>
